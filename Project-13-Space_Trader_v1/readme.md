# 🌌 SPACE TRADER V1.0
> **Note:** This project focuses exclusively on **Backend Development** and game logic. It is a text-based simulation running in the CLI (Command Line Interface) to demonstrate Python architecture, economy algorithms, and data persistence. No GUI is included.
**Space Trader** is a text-based interstellar economy and strategy simulation game written in Python. Become the wealthiest captain in the solar system by trading goods, completing missions, fighting pirates, and managing your fuel and cargo.

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic Economy:** Prices fluctuate based on random galactic news events (e.g., "Gold Rush", "Pirate Blockade", "Great Drought").
* **5 Explorable Planets:** Travel between Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. Each planet has unique resources and distances.
* **Trade System:** Buy low, sell high! Trade resources like Water, Provisions, Electronics, Ore, and Luxury Goods.
* **Exclusive Goods:** Rare items like *Saffron (Earth)*, *Rust (Mars)*, or *Ice (Saturn)* can only be bought on specific planets.
* **Combat & Events:** Random encounters with Pirates and Police during travel. Choose to fight, bribe, or flee.
* **Faction System:** Align yourself with **Pirates**, **Police**, or stay **Independent**. Your choice affects gameplay and prestige.
* **Mission System:** Complete contracts (e.g., "Supply Water to Mars") to earn bonus credits.
* **Ship Upgrades:** Buy larger ships with increased cargo capacity from the Shipyard.
* **Save & Load:** Full persistence system using JSON. Save your progress and resume later.

### 🌍 The Solar System

| Planet | Cheap Resource | Expensive Resource | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Earth** | Saffron | Antimatter | The starting point. |
| **Mars** | Rust | Nitrogen | The Red Planet. |
| **Jupiter** | Hydrogen | Metal | The largest market. |
| **Saturn** | Helium | Ice | Ringed giant. |
| **Venus** | Java | Oxygen | High risk, high reward. |

## ⚠️ Important Strategy Tips

1.  **Watch Your Fuel:** If your fuel reaches 0 during travel, it's **GAME OVER**. Always refuel at the station (Option 11).
2.  **Unique Goods:** Some items (like Saffron or Rust) are unique to their home planets. You might need to find specific buyers or hold them for future updates (Black Market v2.0).
3.  **News Matters:** Always check the news after traveling. If "Industrial Accident" happens, Electronics prices will skyrocket!

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.13**
* **JSON** (For data persistence)
* **OS/Random** (Standard libraries)

## 🔜 Future Roadmap (v2.0)
